# Introduction

If you're like me and value the privacy of your personal images or videos (or maybe you just don't want to pay for services like Google Photos & Amazon Photos), but still want the benifits of being able to revisit you memories on your portable devices, the this app is sure to help. The aim of this project is to compress the entire image / video library to a small enough size that can by synced over to your phone or other porable devices. I shrunk down my 385GB image and video library to 27GB; which I put on my phone storage.

Although the process to set up and run this application is painful at the moment, it does provide a nice GUI and is highly configurable. In order to get started, follow the setup instructions below. In the near future, I aim to add features like media encryption, ability to fetch originals on demand, etc.

## Syncing Media to Portables

Although you could just copy over the compressed / converted files to your portable device, the best option is to setup [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) to automatially sync the converted files to your "DCIM" directory on your portable devices. This works on LAN as well over the internet.

## Setup Instructions

1. Setup VSCode with Python extension (Tested with Python: 3.7.5)
1. Download python3 for Win. Do “brew install python3” for Mac.
1. Check `python3 --version` (mac) , `py -3 --version` (win)
1. Create project dir and open in VSCode
1. Select Python interpreter in VSCode
1. Create **virtual environment**

    * Mac

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    * Win
      (If error then allow execution: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process)

    ```bash
    py -3 -m venv .venv
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
    .venv\scripts\activate
    ```

1. Download **ExifTool** (Tested with 11.76) binary - <https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/>. Ensure `exiftool` is on PATH.
1. The requirements.txt file has been created using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages.
1. Install **ImageMagick** (Tested with 7.0.9) - <http://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.5.7/guide/install.html>. Ensure "MAGICK_HOME" has been setup properly. Also ensure that RAW handling binaries are available; which can be checked by running `convert -list configure`.

    * Installing RAW support libraries on Mac

    ```bash
    brew install dcraw
    brew install ufraw
    ```

1. Install **ffmpeg** (Tested with 4.2.1) - <https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html>. Make sure `ffmpeg` is on PATH.
1. Install **Qt Creator** (Tested with 5.12.x) if you want to change the UI - <https://www.qt.io/offline-installers>.

## Running the App

Simply launch ApplicationWindow.py in VSCode to start the application. This should pop up the main application window.

### Multithreading (Maximizing Conversion Speed)

Make sure that you have "worker" count is equal to the number of logical CPU cores.

If you want to offload video conversion to your **Nvidia GPU**, you will need to a version of **ffmpeg** that support hardware encoding. Since this type of ffmpeg binary is not distributable, you will need compile it from source. For windows, the easiest way to do this was [media-autobuild_suite](https://github.com/m-ab-s/media-autobuild_suite). However, there are many other options available as mentioned [ffmpeg compilation guide](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide). Basically, you need "--enable-cuda-nvcc" / "--enable-libnpp" support in your ffmpeg binary, which in-turn requires [Nvidia's CUDA SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) to run.

Once you have ffmpeg setup, crank up the GPU count and workers to indicate that you want to convert videos using your GPU. I've tested parallel conversion on 2 X Nvidia GTX 1080 GPUs on my Windows 10 machine and they really accelerate the video conversion. Note that consumer GPUs like these only support a limited number of conversions in parallel so conversion will actually fail if you want to have more than one worker per GPU. To remove this restriction, apply this [nvidia-patch](https://github.com/keylase/nvidia-patch).

### Building Binary

Execute the following command to build the binary:

    ```
    pyinstaller --noconfirm 'pyinstaller/batch-media-compressor.spec'
    codesign --entitlements 'pyinstaller/app.entitlements' -s 'Batch Media Compressor Code Signing' 'dist/Batch Media Compressor.app'
    ```
